This plugin is the official Hubalz plugin for installing the tracking script to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Copy your domain token from the Integration page, or from Account -> Settings, and paste that in the plugin settings.

If you want Hubalz not to track input fields, you can check the box for that. (Keep in mind that Hubalz automatically disregards password input fields)

Reach out to us at hello@hubalz.com if you have any questions.
